    "1. What is Python, and why is it popular? \n",
    "   - Python is a highly interpreted programming language known for readability and simplicity,\n",
    "     it was created by Guido van rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
    "     ### Reasons for Python's Popularity:\n",
    "   - All the framework that is necessary to have are in python\n",
    "   - Widely used in iindustries\n",
    "   - Readability and simplicity\n",
    "   - Widely used in data industry\n",
    "   - Python has a lot of liabraries\n",
    "   - Python has a strong community\n",
    "   - Very easy to learn\n",
    "   - Verstile and automation\n",
    "   - Image prcessing\n",
    "     \n",
    "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
    "   - A python interpreter is a program that reads and executes python code line by line, it translate the code into mahcine in readable and executes.\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
    "   - Pre-defined keywords refers to the reserved keywords that holds special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers.\n",
    "   - like >> if, else, true, false, while, for, cotinue, break, elif etc..\n",
    "     \n",
    "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
    "   - No keywords cannot be used as variale names, keywords are reserved words and have special meaning.\n",
    "     \n",
    "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
    "   - Mutability in python refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it has been created. in other words mutability holds that object which can be changed and modified after creation.\n",
    "   - like >> list, sets, dictionaries etc..\n",
    "     \n",
    "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
    "   - Because list has the ability to change after it has been created, we can add, remove or change its elements whenever we want.\n",
    "   - But tuple has no any ability to change or modified thats why it is immutable, Once a tuple is created we cannot modified its elements.\n",
    "     \n",
    "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
    "   - They have diffrent purpose like wise..\n",
    "   - in python \"==\" this is a comparison operator, it determines wheather the value of two variables are equal or not.\n",
    "   - but \"is\" this is a identitiy opreator,  this operator is used to check if two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
    "     \n",
    "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
    "   - These operators are used to combine conditional statements.\n",
    "   -      >> and: returns true if both statements are true.\n",
    "   -      >>  or: returns true if at least one statement is true. \n",
    "   -      >> not: reverse the result if result is true it return false\n",
    "     \n",
    "9.  What is type casting in Python?\n",
    "    - The type casting in python it refers to the conversion of one data type into another data type, this is often necessary whe you want to perform operations that require compatible data types or when you want to ensure that a variable is of a specific type.\n",
    "    - int()\n",
    "    - float()\n",
    "    - str()\n",
    "      \n",
    "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
    "    - Implicit >> Python automatically converts one data type into another without explicit instructions from the user.\n",
    "    \n",
    "              # a = 5 #int()\n",
    "              # b = 2.0 #float()\n",
    "              # c = a + b\n",
    "              # c = 7.0 # float()\n",
    "    - Explicit >> The user manually converts one data type into another data type using the functions.\n",
    "    - like >> int(), float(), str()\n",
    "    - a = \"5\"  #str()\n",
    "    - b = int(a)  #where int(a) converts a = (\"5\") into int()\n",
    "      \n",
    "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
    "    - Control Flow: Conditional statements control the flow of execution in a program. They determine which block of code should run based on certain conditions.\n",
    "    - Decision Making: They allow the program to make decisions. For example, you can check user input, validate data, or determine the outcome of a calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - if   >> executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.\n",
    "    - elif >> stands for \"else if\" and allows you to check multiple conditions.\n",
    "    - else >> executes a block of code if none of the preceding conditions are true.\n",
    "      \n",
    "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
    "    - elif >> stands for \"else if\" and allows you to check multiple conditions, if the first condition is false then it moves to next condition that is elif and check wheather it is true or false, if it is true then it prints the statement whichever we want to print, if it false then it moves to next block of code.\n",
    "      \n",
    "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
    "    - In python loops are used to execute code repeatdly based on condition on over a sequence of items.\n",
    "    - for loop >> The for loop is used to iterat over a sequence. it allows you to execute a block of code for each items in sequence.\n",
    "      like >> list, tuple, str, range\n",
    "    - while loop >> The while loop repeatdly executes a block of code as long as specified condition is true.\n",
    "      \n",
    "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
    "    - Imagine a situation where you are finding you name into file which has already thousand of names until your name met. You dont know how many names are there in a file, so you need to keep finding untill the condition is false, in a such case while loop is more suitable because the  number of iteration needed is not know in advance.\n",
    "          \n"
